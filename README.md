# PyGMDL

PyGMDL is a Python implementation of Gaussian Mixture Descriptors Learner ([GMDL](https://github.com/brenolf/gmdl)). 

This library provides an online classifier based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, using Online Kernel Density Estimators for density modeling.

It was developed in the context of an academic project and as part of a port from existing C++ implementations.
